# Overview
This project is part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree program of Udacity.

> In this project, i will make use of Python to get user input that will guide the data exploration effort for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. During the project the data sets were manipulated via pandas to compute descriptive statistics about various variables included in the data. 

This project is my very first exposure to the kinds of steps that a data analyst takes when they approach a dataset. The steps of the data analysis process that i went through here will be covered in more depth as i continue on with the Nanodegree program.

## Datasets

The data comprises three csv files:
    1. [Washington data](./washington.csv) 
    2. [Chicago data](./chicago.csv)
    3. [NYC data](./new_york_city.csv)
